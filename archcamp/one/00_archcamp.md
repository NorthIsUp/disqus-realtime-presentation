# What? #
* Talks about awesome architecture
* Without having to listen to a sales pitch


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Who? #
* For us (engineers)
* By us (the same engineers)
* None of them (recruiters and sales guys)


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Why another meet-up? #
* The guy on stage talks way to long
* Never get to the heart of interesting tech
* Other meet-ups are run by them<br/>(recruiters and sales guys)


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Format? #
* Start with a few (strictly) 5 minute tech talks
* All of them are on similar subjects
* Transition to an open space style discussion
* Because you are as smart as the speaker and have good ideas too


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# I'ma let you finish... #
* before you ask any questions
* this means:<br/>hold all questions until all talks are done
* (that is only, like 15 minutes, you can do it)
